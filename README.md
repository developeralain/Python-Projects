# Python-Projects
Here are my basic projects that I wrote in Python. They utilize various modules, including tkinter and sqlite3.

## Projects
- [Phonebook Application](https://github.com/developeralain/Python-Projects/blob/main/FileTransfer_Assignment_Part3.py)
- [Check Files GUI](https://github.com/developeralain/Python-Projects/tree/main/project_phonebook)

###### PhoneBook App
This project serves as a phone book application for a user: it saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in the sqlite3 database and allows the user to update or delete previously stored entires 


###### Check Files GUI
This project involves an application that allows the user to automatically transfer all .txt files from a directory of his or her choosing to any other directory. An algorhythm was incorporated to only transfer .txt files that were modified within the last 24 hrs.
